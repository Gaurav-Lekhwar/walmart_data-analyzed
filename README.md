### End-to-End SQL + Python Project

---

## 📌 About the Project

This project is an **end-to-end data analysis pipeline** built using **Python and SQL** to analyze Walmart sales data and extract meaningful business insights.

The main objectives of this project are:
- Practice **real-world data cleaning**
- Use **SQL queries to answer business questions**
- Understand how **Python integrates with databases**
- Build a **portfolio-ready data analyst project**

This project is designed for **beginners and freshers** looking to gain hands-on experience with retail sales data.

## 📂 Dataset Information

- **Source:** Kaggle  
- **Dataset Name:** Walmart Sales Dataset  

The dataset includes information related to:
- Orders and transactions  
- Product categories and pricing  
- Store branches and cities  
- Customer types and payment methods  
- Quantity sold and revenue  

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy**
- **SQL (PostgreSQL)**
- **SQLAlchemy**
- **psycopg2**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **VS Code**
- **Git & GitHub**

---

## 🧩 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Environment Setup
- Created a structured project workspace using **VS Code**
- Used a **Python virtual environment (venv)** to manage project dependencies

---

### 2️⃣ Kaggle API Setup
- Configured Kaggle API to download the dataset
- Stored raw data inside the `data/` folder

---

### 3️⃣ Data Loading & Exploration
- Loaded the CSV file into a **Pandas DataFrame**
- Performed initial exploration using:
  - `.head()`
  - `.info()`
  - `.describe()`

This helped in understanding column names, data types, and missing values.

---

### 4️⃣ Data Cleaning
Data cleaning was performed using **Pandas**:

- Removed duplicate records
- Handled missing values
- Corrected incorrect data types
- Cleaned currency values (e.g., removed `$` symbols)
- Validated the cleaned dataset

Raw and cleaned data were stored **separately** to maintain data integrity.

---

### 5️⃣ Feature Engineering
- Created new calculated columns such as **total sales amount**
- Derived meaningful fields to simplify further SQL analysis

---

### 6️⃣ Loading Data into PostgreSQL
- Connected Python to **PostgreSQL** using `SQLAlchemy` and `psycopg2`
- Created database tables programmatically
- Inserted the cleaned dataset into PostgreSQL
- Verified data insertion using basic SQL queries

This step simulates a **real-world analytics data pipeline**.

---

### 7️⃣ SQL-Based Analysis & Business Questions
SQL queries were written to answer key business questions such as:

- Total revenue generated by Walmart
- Store-wise and city-wise sales performance
- Top-selling product categories
- Sales distribution by payment method
- Customer type contribution to revenue
- Daily and monthly sales trends
- Average order value across stores

These queries helped convert data into **actionable insights**.

---

## 📊 Results & Key Insights

Some of the important insights obtained from the analysis include:

- Certain product categories contribute significantly to total revenue
- Sales performance varies across store locations
- Digital payment methods are widely preferred
- Regular customers contribute a major share of revenue
- Sales show clear time-based and location-based patterns

These findings highlight how data-driven analysis can support business decisions.

---

## 🎯 Conclusion

This project demonstrates a complete **end-to-end data analysis workflow** using **Python and SQL** on real-world retail data.

Through data cleaning, feature engineering, database integration, and SQL analysis, meaningful insights were extracted that reflect real business scenarios.

This project helped strengthen skills in:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- SQL querying and analysis
